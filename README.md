# Resume Website (GitHub Pages Ready)

This is a minimal, professional one-page resume site for **Dao Nguyen**.

## How to host on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repo named: `username.github.io`
2. Upload all files in this folder to the repo root.
3. Commit & push. Your site will be live at `https://username.github.io/`.

## Customize
- `index.html`: edit your name, contacts, sections.
- `assets/img/avatar.png`: replace with your photo (84x84 or larger).
- `assets/css/style.css`: tweak colors/spacing if needed.
